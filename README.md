## Development

Once you download the source from Github. Navigate to the downloaded folder using the command line and run the following command. You will need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed. All scripts use bash.

`npm install`

This will download and install the required packages, it may take some time to install everything. 

Once that has finished use the following command to run and test the current source.

`npm start`

Use the following command to build a standalone application for the current platform.

`npm run build`

Use the setupVersion script to create standalone applications for all platforms in a `dist` folder. This will also format `package.json`, `updates.json` and the created applications for release. [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) is required.

`./formatVersion 'versionNumber'`

To generate documentation from `docs/doc.md`, use the `make` script. This requires [pandoc](https://pandoc.org).
